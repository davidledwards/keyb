usage: keyb OPTIONS
       keyb --help
       keyb --version

  Echoes individual bytes read from the terminal until ^C is pressed. If STDIN
  is not a terminal, then the input stream is processed as a sequence of bytes
  and terminates.

  This program is useful for observing sequences of bytes generated by various
  combinations of keystrokes. For example, Unicode characters would be encoded
  as a sequence of bytes.

  By default, each byte read from the terminal is displayed on a single line
  of output as follows:

    ddd xx ooo bbbbbbbb [name]

  where ddd, xx, ooo, and bbbbbbbb are the decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and
  binary forms, and [name] is a name printed only when bytes are in the range
  of [0,127].

  Any of --dec, --hex, --oct, --bin, and --name can be used to print only those
  forms instead of the default behavior of printing all. However, --name by
  itself implies that all forms will be printed.

  optional:
    --dec, -d    : print decimal form
    --hex, -h    : print hexadecimal form
    --oct, -o    : print octal form
    --bin, -b    : print binary form
    --name, -n   : print description
