Echoes individual bytes generated by keystrokes.

USAGE
  keyb OPTIONS
  keyb --help

  Echoes individual bytes read from the terminal until ^C is pressed. If STDIN
  is not a terminal, then the input stream is processed as a sequence of bytes
  and terminates.

  This program is useful for observing sequences of bytes generated by various
  combinations of keystrokes. For example, Unicode characters would be encoded
  as a sequence of bytes.

  By default, each byte read from the terminal is displayed on a single line
  of output as follows:

    [*] ddd xx ooo bbbbbbbb [name]

  Where ddd, xx, ooo, and bbbbbbbb are the decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and
  binary forms, and [name] is a name printed only when bytes are in the range
  of [0,127].

  The `*` is printed as a prefix when at least one byte becomes available in
  STDIN following a previously empty buffer, essentially designed to show
  sequences of related bytes.

  Any of --dec, --hex, --oct, --bin, and --name can be used to print only those
  forms instead of the default behavior of printing all. However, --name by
  itself implies that all forms will be printed.
